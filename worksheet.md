# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
   Both github and bitbucket help developers collbaorate via hosting repositories and providing, issue tracking, and project management. github in primarily git based, with a collection of open source projects available to access with vast communities. whereas bitbucket supports both git and mercurial, often favoured by enterprises for its integration with Atlassian tools like Jira. 

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
   Matthew Roberts

  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
   Jon Mountjoy

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
   DavePearce

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
   Both of the project made the latest commit 2 approximately 2 years ago, so we can tell that these projects are not active at the moment. And since both projects are left with comments such "next release" "conversion", it is expectaed that these projects moved platforms.

  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
   


# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
